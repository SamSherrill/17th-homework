## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Business Context

A consumer will reach their fitness goals quicker when they track their workout progress.

## Acceptance Criteria

When the user loads the page, they are given the option to create a new workout, or continue with their last workout.

The user is able to:

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan, or continue a previous workout by adding new exercises to it.
